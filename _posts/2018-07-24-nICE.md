I am excited to teach aspiring computational economists at
the [new Initiative on Computational Economics](https://sites.google.com/site/kenjuddnice2018/home). This is the latest
incarnation of [Ken Judd's](https://web.stanford.edu/~judd/) legendary [ICE](ice.uchicago.edu) summer program to teach
graduate students how to correctly compute answers to economic problems.

I will speak on both software engineering methods for scientists and how to approximate high dimensional integrals
both accurately and efficiently. See the [schedule](https://sites.google.com/site/kenjuddnice2018/home/schedule) for details.
