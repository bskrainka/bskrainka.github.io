Today, [DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com) launched a new podcast on data science,
[DataFramed](https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast),
in which [Hugo Browne-Anderson](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/hugobowne) interviews me and several
other top data scientists, including 
[Hilary Mason](https://hilarymason.com),
[Christopher T. Volinsky](http://www.research.att.com/~volinsky) (AT&T),
[David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org) (Stack Overflow),
[Claudia Perlich](https://sites.google.com/site/claudiaperlich/home) (DStillery), and
[Ma&euml;lle Salmon](http://www.masalmon.eu/).

My interview is a wide-ranging discussion about practicing data science, how to get started
in the profession, and how [Convoy](https://convoy.com) uses data and science to transform the trucking industry.
