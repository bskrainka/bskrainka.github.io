I created this site to share my thoughts about data science with scientists outside my immediate
circle of colleagues. In the weeks ahead, I will share war stories, best practices, and practical
research for practitioners, all based on several decades of using math, software, theory, and, of
course good judgment and humor to solve scientific problems.
