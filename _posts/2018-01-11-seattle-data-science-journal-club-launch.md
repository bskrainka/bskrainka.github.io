I love working as a data scientist in industry with rich data and fascinating, real-world 
problems.  But, I miss having access to high quality seminars where I could
discuss the latest research and ideas with peers. 
Looking at the flourishing data science journal clubs in
[Silicon Valley](https://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Data-Science-Journal-Club/?_cookie-check=8JqBejiS8KtzrbG6)
and [London](https://www.meetup.com/London-Data-Science-Journal-Club/),
I was keen to launch a similar meetup in Seattle.

Today, [Convoy](https://convoy.com/) sponsored and launched a new meetup, the
Seattle Data Science Journal Club, to help data scientists remain on the forefront of the
profession.  Now, Seattle Data Scientist have a forum to talk about the latest
research and network with peers. 
Almost 30 data scientists attended to discuss Wager & Athey’s 2017
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04342)
“Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Using Random
Forests.”  The monthly sessions alternate between a speaker series, with top
data scientists, and a seminar series, where we discuss a paper.


Wager & Athey (2017) is part of an exciting new strand of literature which
combines machine learning techniques and econometrics to estimate treatment
effects more robustly. Because data scientists often have to measure causal
effects to determine the optimal (enough) policy for some problem, most of us
can readily apply these techniques in our work. You can read more about our
discussion of this paper in the [slides](http://benjaminskrainka.com/talks/M1_WagerAthey.pdf)
which I prepared for the meetup.
